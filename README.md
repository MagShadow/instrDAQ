# instrDAQ
## Description
* This program acquires data from a group of instruments after triggering a continuous or discrete sweep from one of them.

  * A continuous sweep sweeps a continous output such as a magnetic field or the time. The sweep is done by instruments themselves and the program only triggers it. A command may be needed to pause the sweep.
  
  * A discrete sweep sweeps a discrete output such as a gate vlotage. The work is done by the program: the program sends commands to an instrument one by one, setting the value of an output discretely.
  
  * 2D or 3D scan can be made with an sweep sequence.
  
  * More complicated sweeps are possible. You may need to wrote your own wrapper program to wrap the complicated sweeps or trying other programs such as qtlab (an open-source python-based data acquisition program).

* The program communicates with instruments by VISA

  * VISA is like a translator. Commands can be send to (read from) insturments by the VISA write (read) function, no matter what kind of interface is used. One can simply use VISA write and read functions to talk to instruments through serial, GPIB, ethernet or USB ports.

  * The addresses, commands and interface/communication parameters are collected in text files. New instrument supports can be added without changing the program itself!

## <a name="how2">How to</a>
### Install
* Download the whole project and open it with LabVIEW 8.6 or later versions.
* Use the program by running main.vi or compiling it into an exe. The former method enables one to run the program on a Mac even if it was developed on a PC. The latter method enables one to run the program in a computer without LabVIEW installed.
* Make sure NI-VISA and other device drivers (such as NI-4882) have been installed.
### Read data from instruments, such as an SR830 lock-in amplifier or a 2400 sourcemeter
* Connect instruments to your computer. Check the connection by sending simple commands. Many instruments would response to the command `*IDN?`, which queries the instrument identifications. You can know instruments by reading their manuals.
* Find out the command for taking data. Commands you need are usually listed somewhere in the manuals. For SR830, the command returning x and y is `SNAP?1,2`.
* Add the following code to the file "Model". You can run main.vi or exe without a Model file, they will generate an empty one, usually in the same folder but sometimes in the parent folder (depends on LabVIEW versions and operating systems).
```
[SR830]
CheckStr=830
RdName=#d1&#d2
RdCmd=SNAP?1,2
[24xx_noout]
CheckStr=24
RdName=#_V&#_I&#_R&#_t&#_s
RdCmd=:READ?
```  
Make sure there are two other files, named "config.ini" and "instrGroup1", in the sample file as "Model". If they don't exist, create them. Write the following code into "config.ini":
```
[config]
instrGroup=instrGroup1
user=user1,user2
```
The code specifies a file name (which is "instrGroup1" here) for the program to get address information of instruments and specifies user names ("user1" and "user2"). 

Add the following code to the file "instrGroup1".
```
[GPIB0::1::INSTR]
Model=SR830
Alias=L1
[GPIB0::2::INSTR]
Model=SR830
Alias=L2
[GPIB0::11::INSTR]
Model=24xx
Alias=smu1
```
Replace the addresses ([GPIB0::1::INSTR]) with correct ones. Run the program. The program will try sending `*IDN?` to each address listed here to check whether an instrument is powered on and whether the _Model_ specified in "instrGroup1" is correct. A check is passed if there is a response and the response contains the _CheckStr_ in file "Model". The instrument will then be listed in the front panel of the program. If you don't want a check or if the instrument wouldn't response to `*IDN?`, just delete that line (CheckStr=\*\*\*) in "Model". Â 

_RdCmd_ is the command querying readings.

_RdName_ is the name of readings. If there are multiple readings returned by one command, seperate them with "&".

_Alias_ is used to replace the "#" in _RdName_.

### Add more than one commands in a single Model
*   Just seperate them with "/", 6221 current source for example,
```
[6221]
CheckStr=6221
RdName=#_I/#_V&#_time
RdCmd=:SOUR:CURR?/:SENSE:DATA?
```
### Sweep the output, for example, of a voltage source or a magnet power supply.
*	If the ramping requires you sending commands at each loop, add `SwpAvl=FALSE` in corresponding model. For example, if you want ramp the output of a sourcemeter from 0V to 1V, step=0.1V, you should send 11 commands. The program of ramping runs in the computer rather than in the instruments.  The _OutName_ should begin with a name existing in _RdName_, followed by a ":" and then whatever else. The program determines the value of the output by readings with the name before ":". The ramping stops when your setting is reached or a stop bottom is pressed. The "#" in _OutCmd_ will be replaced with real numbers in each loop. Following are examples for 2400 and 2600 series SourceMeter.
```
[24xx]
CheckStr=24
RdName=#_V&#_I&#_3&#_4&#_5
RdCmd=:READ?
SwpAvl=FALSE
OutName="#_V: (V)"
OutCmd=":SOUR:VOLT #"
[26xx]
CheckStr=26
RdName=#_I&#_V
RdCmd=printnumber(smua.measure.iv())
SwpAvl=FALSE
OutName="#_I: (A)/#_V: (V)"
OutCmd=smua.source.leveli=#/smua.source.levelv=#
```
* For instruments taking care of ramping themselves, you only need to send the command once before the loop. Set `SwpAvl=TRUE` in the model. Maybe you want add a command to pause the ramping, just leave it behind the ramping command and seperate them with "&". If no pausing command is provided, the ramping will continue after the program stopped, not a big problem for some instrumens. The following is an example of 4G and 625 magnet power supply
```
[4G]
CheckStr=4G
RdName="B (9T)/B (4T)"
RdCmd="CHAN 2;IMAG?/CHAN 1;IMAG?"
SwpAvl=TRUE
OutName="B (9T): Sweep Up/B (9T): Sweep Down/B (9T): Sweep Zero/B (4T): Sweep Up/B (4T): Sweep Down/B (4T): Sweep Zero"
OutCmd="CHAN 2;Sweep up slow&CHAN 2;Sweep pause slow/CHAN 2;Sweep down slow&CHAN 2;Sweep pause slow/CHAN 2;Sweep zero slow&CHAN 2;Sweep pause slow/CHAN 1;Sweep up slow&CHAN 1;Sweep pause slow/CHAN 1;Sweep down slow&CHAN 1;Sweep pause slow/CHAN 1;Sweep zero slow&CHAN 1;Sweep pause slow"
[625]
CheckStr=625
RdName="B (A)"
RdCmd=RDGI?
SwpAvl=TRUE
OutName="B (A): Ramping"
OutCmd="SETI #&STOP"
```
### Add a model that echos/require terminator/baud rate not 9600...
Add a line like the following to the corresponding model
```
AdvPara = [init cmd],[echo/baud rate/data bits/parity/stop bits],[terminator/multiline?],[count/offset]
```
Each parameter, seperated by `,` or `/` on the right side of the `=`, can be left empty if default value is desired. For example, `AdvPara = ,////,/,/` will set all advanced parameters to their default values.
A rightmost `/` in square brackets or a rightmost `,` can be omitted. For example, `,////,/,/` equals to `,///,,` equals to `,,,` equals to `,,` equals to an empty string. `,////,/,/0` does not equal to `,////,/,0` since the sixth `/` is not rightmost.
* `init cmd`: A command which will send to the instrument during the initialization. Since `,` has its special meaning in `AdvPara`, an `init cmd` containing `,` would lead to errors in current version. 
* `echo`: 0 if no command echoes. 1 if the command for reading data echoes. 2 if the command for setting echoes. 3 if both commands echo. If a command echoes, you should read for an extra time before getting the desired response.
* `baud rate/data bits/parity/stop bits`: Parameters for a serial port. Valid only if the interface type is the serial port and these 4 parameters and `echo` are all not empty.
* `terminator`: Terminator of commands. 
* `multiline?`: By default, commands sent to the same instrument will be packed into one string, seperated by `;`. Add something like `AdvPara=,,/FALSE` to avoid packing.
* `count`: Number of bytes read by the `VISA Read` function. Valid only if >128.
* `offset`: The program converts every number in a string returned by the `VISA Read` function. Use `offset` to intercepts a portion of the string.
### Sweep with commands requiring two parameters
The `Step` on the program interface can be used as a second parameter for `OutCmd` when the value of `SwpAvl` is `TRUE` and there is a `##` in `OutCmd`. The `#` in `OutCmd` will be replaced with `To` and the `##` with `Step`.
### a reading command returns very very many readings
Use `RdName=name{n}`, which equals to `RdName=name1&name2&name3...$namen`
### Delay after executing a command
`cmd@seconds@message`

For example, we can set the `OutCmd` of the Oxford's VRM as `SET:SYS:VRM:RVST:MODE:RATE:RATE:0.1:VSET:[# 0 ##]@5@seting parameters...`
### Add a model that doesn't talk to VISA read and write
Write a wrapper program like this https://github.com/cover-me/tcp-visa-server. Communicate with the wrapper function using `VISA read` and `VISA write`.

...
## <a name="np">Known problems</a>
In order to be more effecient, the program sends commands to all instruments before reading any replies. Sometimes one wants to send multiple commands to an instrument for multiple readings. If the instrument works well with multiple commands in one line like `cmd1;cmd2;cmd3`, that is fine. Else, if the instrument receives commands one by one but you can read them by one reading action,it is still fine, just set `multiline?'` as False. Else (very rare), you can download the branch "stable_write1_read1", which will read reply immediately after every writing.

Another solution is to modifiy the code. Add a switch disabling the termination character when `count` is nonzero and calculate the exact bytes returned...
